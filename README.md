# Implementations of some features we may want to use in our projects

-- this project is not even started yet. I'll update this README when something is ready to be shared.

## Some goals

- starfx store setup;
- webworkers for persistence handling;
- webworkers for data processing;
- persistence in indexedDB;
- back-up persisted data on the server;
- efficient hydration of the store;
- multi-tenant stores and persistence - switching between tenants;
- large hystorical data-scenrios;
      - data fetching: load totals only, load details on demand
      - data fetching: sharded data fetching;
      - persistence: recent shard persitnece, older data in indexedDB directly;
